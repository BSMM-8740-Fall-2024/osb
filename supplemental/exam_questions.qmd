## Notes on quizes, midterms and the final exam

Each quiz, midterm and the final exam will consist of two parts:

1.  **Part 1 - Conceptual:** Simple questions designed to evaluate your familiarity with the written course notes.
2.  **Part 2 - Applied:** Data analysis in RStudio (like a usual lab, but simpler).

## Conceptual Questions

Here are examples of the conceptual questions that might be asked:

What is the primary difference between inner_join() and left_join()?
a) inner_join() keeps all rows from both tables, left_join() keeps all rows from the left table
b) inner_join() keeps only matching rows, left_join() keeps all rows from the left table
c) inner_join() is faster, left_join() is more accurate
d) There is no difference

In the context of tidy data, which of the following is NOT a principle?
a) Every column is a measurement
b) Every row is an observation
c) Every cell is a single value
d) Every dataset has multiple tables

What does the `step_dummy()` function in recipes do?
a) Remove duplicate rows
b) Create dummy variables for categorical predictors
c) Impute missing values
d) Scale numeric variables

Which of the following is NOT a step in the typical Tidymodels workflow?
a) Data splitting
b) Model specification
c) Model training
d) Database querying

## Applied Questions

Here are examples of the applied questions that might be asked:

Using the `ggplot2::diamonds` dataset. Using tidyverse functions:
a) Create a new variable called 'size' that is the product of x, y, and z.
b) Filter out any diamonds with a price greater than \$10,000 or less than \$500.
c) Fit a multiple regression model predicting price based on carat, cut, and size.
d) Use broom::augment() to add residuals and fitted values to your dataset.

Using the `datasets::mtcars` dataset, create a linear regression model to predict mpg based on wt and hp. Use the tidyverse and broom packages to:
a) Create a tibble with only the mpg, wt, and hp columns.
b) Fit the linear model.
c) Extract the model coefficients and their p-values into a tidy tibble.
